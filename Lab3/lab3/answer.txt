Integer is a class while int is primitive, so when we ran Flik, java automatically turns an int type into an Integer object
when the isSameNumber method is invoked, since isSameNumber expected Integer objects as input, not int primitive type.
However, Integer, is only cached between -128 and 127, so the same objects will be used. But beyond that range, separate
objects will be created and thus the reference is different. Hence, the loop breaks at i = 128.
